PAL -- Palliative Care Application
==================================

Background
----------
This application is a component of my Barrett Honors undergraduate thesis project. The application allows patients to enter data about symptoms they feel on a modified version of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). The application also allows physicians to view the data entered by the users.

To Run
------
This repository should contain all necessary files to run the application on any system with OSX and a compatible version of Xcode. Simply clone the repository and open the .xcodeproj file. Xcode may prompt you to checkout other working copies of the open-source repositories used for this project; allow this to occur. From there, simply build the application in Xcode.
