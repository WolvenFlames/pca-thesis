Overview
-------

Allows testing of asynchronous APIs using XCTest much like [gh-unit](https://github.com/gabriel/gh-unit).

Pleasee see [issues](https://github.com/premosystems/XCAsyncTestCase/issues?page=1&state=open) for any problems.

Interested users should also check out [XCTAsyncTestCase](https://github.com/iheartradio/xctest-additions), another awesome async library for XCTest.

Install
-------

Add `XCTestCase+AsyncTesting.h` and `XCTestCase+AsyncTesting.m` to your project.

...or via [cocoapods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) `pod 'XCAsyncTestCase'`

Usage
-----

1. Add `#import "XCTestCase+AsyncTesting.h"` to tests that need to be asynchronous. 
- Optional: add `#define XCA_SHORTHAND` to your .pch file and enjoy methods without the XCA_ prefix. (new as of v1.0.0)
2. Create your test cases as usual
3. Call `-XCA_waitForStatus:timeout:` or `-XCA_waitForTimeout:` after you start your asynchronous call
4. Call `-XCA_notify:` in your callbacks

See `AsyncXCTestingKitTests.m` for more information.
